# MoSoRo
This repository documents the design, fabrication, and control of a modular soft robotic system MoSoRo capable of reconfiguration into a ball. 

## Fabrication

### Mechatronics
The basic mechatronics for the MoSoRo system consist of a microcontroller, DC motors, and motor drivers. The current prototype consists of the following:
- One (1) Arduino Uno Rev3
- Four (4) maxon DC Motors (273687,1105182-05 Rev. E)*
- Four (4) TOSHIBA Full-Bridge DC Motor Driver IC (TB6643KQ8)
